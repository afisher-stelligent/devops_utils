# Useful DevOps Tools

These are some tools that I've created that are very useful in the labs. Most are written in Python or CloudFormation

## The Tools

- [aws-mfa-cli](aws-mfa-cli/README.md): A tool that you can run to create a temporary profile using your MFA device
- [stack-utility](stack-deploy/README.md): A tool that accepts a [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html) template and intelligently deploys the specified stack.
- [vpc-cloudformation](vpc-cloudformation/README.md): A couple of VPC stacks that can be reused for various situations.
